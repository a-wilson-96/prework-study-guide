# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This website is a study guide for the web development bootcamp course. It is sectioned off by subject, with each section containing info and examples of each topic in full stack web development. I built this project to help my understanding of web development and to get me prepared for the work to come in the bootcamp. This will help organize notes by topic as well as boost my skills in full stack literacy. I learned how to integrate my work with Github which will allow me to collaberate with other developers and become successful.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
